#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? --

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2;

-- How many of each type of headphone were sold in February? --

SELECT sum(quantity) as quantity, product
FROM bit_db.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%Headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

-- What was the average amount spent per account in February? --
-- (Hint: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account). --

SELECT sum(quantity) * price / count(cust.acctnum) 
FROM bit_db.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN bit_db.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id;

-- What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? --
-- (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually). --

SELECT sum(quantity) / count(cust.acctnum) 
FROM bit_db.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN bit_db.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id;

-- Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? --

SELECT product, sum(quantity) * price as revenue
FROM bit_db.JanSales Jan
group by product
order by revenue desc
limit 1;
